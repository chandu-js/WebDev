    On this special day, we remember together,

    The countless sacrifices of our brave defenders.

    With love and respect in our hearts, we say, 

    Happy Republic Day, every day.

    As the saffron, white, and green unfurls high,

    Our soar spirits reach the sky.

    With courage, hope, and effort, we make our way,

    For a brighter India, every day.
