    <h1><b>Indian Constitution</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>In 1928, the All Parties Conference convened a committee in Lucknow to prepare the <strong>Constitution of India</strong>, which was known as the <i> Nehru Report</i>.

        With the exception of scattered French and Portuguese exclaves, India was under the British rule from 1858 to 1947. From 1947 to 1950, the same legislation continued to be implemented as India was a dominion of United Kingdom for these three years, as each princely state was convinced by <em> Sardar Patel</em> and V. P. Menon to sign the articles of integration with India, and the British Government continued to be responsible for the external security of the country. Thus, the constitution of India repealed the <mark>Indian Independence Act 1947</mark> and Government of <del>India Act 1935</del> when it became effective on 26 January 1950. India ceased to be a dominion of the British Crown and became a sovereign, democratic republic with the constitution. Articles <small> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392, 393,</small> and <small>394</small> of the constitution came into force on 26 November 1949, and the remaining articles became effective on 26 January 1950 which is celebrated every year in <ins>India</ins> as Republic Day.</p>
